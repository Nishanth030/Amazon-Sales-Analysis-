# Amazon-Sales-Analysis-

In this project, the Sales Status Analysis is a project that focuses on the classification of a variety of textile goods sold in the Amazon.in platform, into different Shipe_status categories. The project aims at modeling the data collected to generate useful insights using various classification algorithms that are used to develop models and test the accuracy of the models.

I have learnt about the CRISP-DM, which is a process model that serves as the base for a data science process. It has six sequential phases, and I have implemented those concepts in this project.
