# Amazon-Sales-Analysis-

▪ In this project, the sales status analysis focuses on the classification of a variety of textile goods sold on Amazon's 
  sales data for textile products, classifying items into ship_status categories.

▪ The project aims at modeling the collected data to generate useful insights using various classification algorithms that are 
  used to develop models and test the accuracy of the models.

▪ Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM algorithms for classification.

▪ Utilized Excel to meticulously clean and preprocess data, ensuring the highest data quality standards were met. And Python 
  programming language with Jupyter Notebook as the primary platform for advanced data analysis and modeling.

▪ Implemented the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to ensure a structured approach to 
  project management. And Evaluated model performance using metrics and provided actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies.
